#C4 Xcode Template Installer

This is the main repo for the files that we use to build the installer.

To run this you have to first install XMLStarlet at http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net (which is pretty easy using HomeBrew)

To build the installer, open terminal, navigate to the C4iOSInstaller directory, then run:

```
sh buildInstaller.sh
```
